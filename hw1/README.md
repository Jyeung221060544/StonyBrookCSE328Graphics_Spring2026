## Overview

- Implemented a sample modern OpenGL program with GLFW as the windowing toolkit. 
- Implemented a naive Bresenham line drawing routine without edge-case handling. 
- Implemented quadratic and cubic polynomial curve rendering using user-specified coefficients read from a configuration file.
- Implemented superquadric (superellipse) rendering using parametric form.
- Curves are rendered in world coordinate system centered at the viewport.
- Successive sampled points are connected using a generalized Bresenham line algorithm to ensure continuity.

## Notes

- All README files for future homework should also comply with the same format as this one. 
- This program template is just for your reference. Please feel free to code your own program (i.e., not using this template). However, the user interface (mouse and keyboard functionalities) should be the same as specified in the homework manual. 
- Please **comply with the submission requirements as detailed on the [TA Help Page](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xihan1/courses/cse328/ta_help_page.html)**. Plesase rename the directory as instructed by the TA Help Page, and submit via Brightspace. 
- Please also make sure you have checked all implemented features with "x"s in the Markdown table below. As speficied on the TA Help Page, only checked features will be considered for grading!

## Dependencies

- OpenGL:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
  - Configuration w.r.t. results of `sudo glxinfo | grep "OpenGL`
  - Command `glxinfo` needs `mesa-utils`
- Remaining dependencies could be installed via apt:
```bash
apt install libopencv-dev libglm-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev mesa-utils libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev
```

## Compile & Run

- Run inside this directory, i.e., `hw1/`: 
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make 
cd ..
./build/hw1
```

## Usage

- If you have implemented extra functionalities not mentioned in the manual,
  you may specify them here.
- If your program failed to obey the required mouse/keyboard gestures,
  you may also specify your own setting here.
  In this case, penalties may apply.

## FAQ: Runtime error "shader file not successfully read"

If you are using the CLion IDE, you should set up the working directory of the project.
First click the "hw1 | Debug" icon on the top-right corner, 
next click "Edit Configurations...", 
then set up the "Working directory" item to the root of your project, 
i.e., the path to `hw1/`
(this directory should be further renamed to `sbuid_hwx` as specified above). 
Note that the working directory must be **exactly** root of your project 
(its parent directories, e.g. path to `StonyBrookCSE328Graphics/`, won't work). 

## Appendix

Please include any other stuff you would like to mention in this section.
E.g., format of your config file, and your suggestions on possible combinations of cubic curve parameters. 

## Appendix

### Configuration File Format (`etc/config.txt`)

The program reads exactly **one line** from:
etc/config.txt

The format is: <type> <parameters>

The first integer specifies the curve type:

- `1` → Cubic Curve  
- `2` → Quadratic Curve  
- `3` → Superquadric  

Only one curve is rendered per execution (the program reads one line from the config file).

---

### 1. Cubic Curve (type = 1)
Format: 1 a3 a2 a1 a0

Represents: y(x) = a3 x^3 + a2 x^2 + a1 x + a0

Example: 1 0.00002 0 0 -50

Produces a smooth S-shaped cubic curve.


---

### 2. Quadratic Curve (type = 2)
Format: 2 a2 a1 a0

Represents: y(x) = a2 x^2 + a1 x + a0

Example: 2 0.002 0 -50

Produces an upward-opening parabola.


---
### 3. Superquadric (Superellipse) (type = 3)
Format: 3 a b n

Parametric form used in implementation: 
- `x(t)` = a * sgn(cos t) * |cos t|^(2/n)
- `y(t)` = b * sgn(sin t) * |sin t|^(2/n)

Where:
- `a` = horizontal radius  
- `b` = vertical radius  
- `n` = exponent controlling the shape  

Example: 3 250 180 2

Produces a standard ellipse.

Rounded rectangle: 3 300 180 8

Diamond shape: 3 250 250 1

Pinched / star-like shape: 3 260 180 0.7

---

### Coordinate System

- The origin (0, 0) is at the center of the viewport.
- The positive x-axis points to the right.
- The positive y-axis points upward.
- World-space coordinates are converted to screen-space internally using `worldToScreen`.

## Implementation Notes

- Polynomial curves are sampled across the world x-range of [-500, 499].
- Successive sample points are connected using Bresenham line drawing in world space.
- Superquadrics are generated using 4000 parametric samples and connected via Bresenham for smooth rasterization.
- All rendering is clipped to the viewport.
